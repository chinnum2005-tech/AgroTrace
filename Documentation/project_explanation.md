# 🌾 FarmConnect (AgriTrace) - Exhaustive System Deep Dive

You asked for *everything*. This document breaks down the entire FarmConnect monorepo, analyzing the exact tables, smart contracts, AI logic, and frontend architectures that make your platform operate.

## 🏛️ 1. Macro-Architecture & Tech Stack

FarmConnect is built as a **Monorepo** using Turborepo to orchestrate multiple distinct applications and microservices.

### The Stacks
1. **Frontend (`apps/web`)**: React + TypeScript + Vite. Styled with Tailwind CSS. It is a fully functional Progressive Web App (PWA) with a Service Worker (`sw.js`) allowing for offline caching—vital for farmers in remote areas with spotty internet.
2. **Backend API (`apps/backend`)**: Node.js + Express.js. Secured by JWT. It serves as the primary gateway for the frontend, communicating with the database.
3. **Database Layer (`apps/backend/prisma`)**: Prisma ORM mapped to a robust **PostgreSQL** database (specifically tuned for Neon).
4. **AI Service (`services/ai-service`)**: Python + FastAPI. Houses independent Machine Learning models for disease detection and yield prediction.
5. **Blockchain Service (`services/blockchain`)**: Hardhat environment for compiling and deploying Solidity Smart Contracts to the **Polygon** network.

## 💾 2. The Data Layer (Prisma Database Schema)

The PostgreSQL database acts as the source of truth for off-chain data. Let's break down the exact tables running your system:

### Core Entity Tables
* **`User` Table**: The heart of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It stores `email`, hashed `password`, and an `enum Role` which strictly defines whether a user is an `ADMIN`, `FARMER`, `DISTRIBUTOR`, or `CONSUMER`.
* **`Farm` Table**: Linked to a Farmer (`userId`). Stores `name`, `size` (in hectares), `certification` (e.g., USDA Organic), and a JSON object for GPS `location` coordinates.
* **`Crop` Table**: The foundation of the supply chain. Tracks the exact `CropType` (Wheat, Corn, Rice, etc.), `plantingDate`, physical `area`, `estimatedYield`, and the current `GrowthStage`. **Crucially, it stores the `qrCode` hash.**
* **`Product` Table**: Once a crop is harvested and packaged, it becomes a Product. It tracks `sku`, `batchNumber`, `expiryDate`, and inventory `quantity`.

### Marketplace & Logistics Tables
* **`Cart` & `CartItem`**: standard e-commerce tables linking a Consumer to Products.
* **`Order` & `OrderItem`**: Tracks purchases. `totalPrice` is calculated in INR (₹) and includes the `shippingAddress`.
* **`Shipment` Table**: Links an `Order` to a `Distributor`. Tracks the `currentLocation`, `estimatedDelivery`, and `status`.

### The Traceability Link
* **`SupplyChainEvent` Table**: This is the bridge to the blockchain. Every time a crop moves, a record is created here. It stores the `eventType` (e.g., PACKAGED, SHIPPED), the `actorId` (who moved it), and the **`transactionHash`** (the exact receipt from the Polygon blockchain).

---

## ⛓️ 3. The Blockchain Subsystem (Web3)

The project doesn't just pretend to use blockchain; it actually executes Solidity smart contracts.

### `SupplyChain.sol` (The Smart Contract)
Located in `services/blockchain/contracts`, this contract is the immutable ledger of your system.
* **The `Event` Struct**: When the Node.js backend pushes an update, the smart contract creates a struct containing the `productId`, the `eventType`, a `timestamp`, the `location`, the `actor` wallet address, and stringified `metadata`.
* **`recordEvent()` Function**: This function writes the data to the blockchain. It generates a unique cryptographic hash `keccak256(productId, eventType, timestamp, msg.sender)` and stores it in the `eventRegistry` mapping. 
* **Immutability**: Because it's on Polygon, once `recordEvent()` is executed, that tracking data is permanent. No admin, hacker, or corrupt middleman can ever delete or alter the history of a crop.

## 🧠 4. The Artificial Intelligence Layer

The `services/ai-service` folder runs a high-performance Python FastAPI server on port 8000. It handles heavy computational ML tasks asynchronously, keeping the Node.js backend fast.

### 🔬 CNN Crop Disease Detection (`disease_predictor.py`)
* **How it works:** When a farmer uploads a leaf image, the frontend sends it via `multipart/form-data` to the `/predict/disease` endpoint.
* **The Model:** It utilizes **PyTorch** and **Torchvision**. It loads a **ResNet18** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
* **Processing:** The image is resized, center-cropped to 224x224 pixels, and normalized using ImageNet standards. The tensor is passed through the network, outputting a Softmax probability distribution.
* **Output:** It returns the specific disease (e.g., Leaf Blight, Powdery Mildew, Rust, or Healthy) and an exact confidence score (e.g., 96.5%).

### 📈 Yield Prediction (`yield_predictor.py`)
* **How it works:** Uses **Scikit-learn** algorithms to process farm data.
* **Processing:** It takes the crop type, farm area, soil quality (pH, nitrogen), and weather data. It normalizes this structured data and runs it through a regression model to estimate exactly how many kilograms of food the field will produce.

## 🖥️ 5. The Frontend Workflows & UI Engineering

The React application (`apps/web/src/pages`) is massive. Here is what actually happens in the UI components:

### 🌗 Global Theming & i18n
* **`index.css` overrides:** The entire app utilizes Tailwind CSS. A global dark mode toggle instantly switches thousands of elements to slate-gray (`bg-gray-800`) and pure white text using advanced CSS variable overrides.
* **Pan-India Translations (`i18n`):** The app supports 11 languages (English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, Punjabi, Odia). A `LanguageSelector.tsx` component updates the `i18next` context, instantly translating the UI to cater to rural farmers across India.

### 👨‍🌾 `FarmerDashboardNew.tsx`
* Uses `recharts` to render beautiful `AreaChart` and `BarChart` components showing yield comparisons and revenue trends.
* Connects to a live weather API, rendering specific temperature, humidity, and wind widgets for the farm's exact location.
* Has a button to **Generate QR**. When clicked, it uses the `qrcode.react` library to dynamically generate a scannable SVG QR code linking to the crop's blockchain ID.

### 👤 `Marketplace.tsx` & `ProductTracePro.tsx`
* Consumers browse grid-layouts of products. When an order is placed, the backend initializes the delivery sequence.
* When a Consumer clicks "Verify", `ProductTracePro.tsx` opens. This component fetches the `SupplyChainEvent` history and renders it as a vertical timeline. Next to every event is a green verified badge with the `transactionHash` proving the event is registered on Polygon.

### 🚚 `DistributorDashboard.tsx`
* A logistics interface showing tables of pending `Shipments`.
* Distributors click "Update Status". This triggers the Node.js backend, which in turn calls the Python service (if routing is needed) and executes the `recordEvent()` function on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

### 👨‍💼 `AdminDashboard.tsx`
* The highest-level overview. Uses **macOS-style animated docks** (`MacDock.tsx`) for navigation.
* Displays total revenue (calculated in ₹), active users, and system API health.
* Includes a global `Cmd+K` command palette (`GlobalSearch.tsx`) allowing the admin to instantly search across the entire SQL database.
* Features a `PDFReportButton.tsx` which uses `jspdf` to convert DOM elements and charts into downloadable PDF files for auditing.

## 🔒 6. Security & Real-World Readiness (2026 Audit Remediated)

Following a comprehensive security audit in May 2026, the platform has been hardened for production-scale deployment:

*   **Hardened Authentication:** JWT tokens have been moved from `localStorage` to **httpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=Strict cookies**, effectively neutralizing token exfiltration via XSS. All authentication endpoints are protected by **strict rate limiting**.
*   **Smart Contract Governance:** The `SupplyChain.sol` contract now uses **OpenZeppelin AccessControl** with granular roles (`FARMER_ROLE`, `DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE`). Event recording is cryptographically secured with manipulatable-resistant hashing (using blockhashes and nonces).
*   **Data Privacy & Compliance:** The system implements **EXIF metadata stripping** for all AI image uploads and utilizes **cryptographically secure random QR identifiers**. Comprehensive **Audit Logging** is implemented for all administrative actions.
*   **Infrastructure Reliability:** Database interactions are optimized with **connection pooling** and **foreign key indexing**. The system serves interactive documentation via **Swagger (OpenAPI)** at `/api-docs`.
*   **PWA Resilience:** The Service Worker (`sw.js`) provides high-availability offline support, critical for rural infrastructure, with automated background synchronization.

*Final Status: All Critical, High, and Medium audit findings (CRIT-001 through MED-012) have been fully remediated. FarmConnect is now architecturally sound and production-ready for global agricultural supply chains.*
